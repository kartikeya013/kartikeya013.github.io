<p> If you're anything like me,</p>
<p>You bite your nails,</p>
<p>And laugh when you're nervous.</p>
<p>You promise people the world,</p>
<p>because that's what they want from you.</p>
<p>You like giving them what they want...</p>
<p>But darling, you need to stop,</p>

<p>If you're anything like me,</p>
<p>You knock on wood every time you make plans.</p>
<p>You cross your fingers, hold your breath,</p>
<p>Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes</p>
<p>Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.</p>
<p>Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...</p>
<p>If life gets too good now,</p>
<p>Darling, it scares you.</p>
</al>
<ul id="right">
<p>If you're anything like me,</p>
<p>You never wanted to lock your door,</p>
<p>Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer</p>
<p>Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore</p>
<p>For fear she was much better before...</p>
<p>But Darling, now you have to.</p>

<p>If you're anything like me,</p>
<p>There's a justice system in your head </p>
<p>For names you'll never speak again,</p>
<p>And you make your ruthless rulings.</p>
<p>Each new enemy turns to steel</p>
<p>They become the bars that confine you,</p>
<p>In your own little golden prison cell...</p>
<p>But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.</p>



<p>If you're anything like me,</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>
But Darling, it's going to be okay.

<ol id="left1">
<h3>When nails grow long, we cut nails not fingers. Similarly when misunderstanding grow up cut your ego not your relationship.</h3>
<h3>You are defined by what pepople think about you or what they whisper behind your back.</h3>
<h3>Ups and down in life are very important to keep us going, beacause a straight line even in ECG means we are not alive.</h3>

<h3>The difficulties of life make us better not bitter</h3>

<h3>Always go with your passions. Never ask yourself if it is realistic or not.</h3>
<h3>Overthinking is the biggest cause of your unhappiness.Keep yourself occupied. Keep your mind off things that don't help you. Think positive :)</h3>
